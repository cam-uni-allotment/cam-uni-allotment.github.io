<img src="/matriculation-photo-full.jpeg" width="200" class="left-img"/>

I have recently started my PhD in [Health Data Science](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/careers-in-health-data-science/phd-programme/) at the University of Cambridge, with a studentship from Health Data Research UK, the Alan Turing Institute, and the Wellcome Trust. 

Before this, I was a DeepMind Scholar in MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, where my research project focused on fairness in machine learning. The photo of me here is from the happy day I signed a very big book to matriculate into Clare Hall College, which is a wonderful college - not only because of the name!

I completed my first-class BSc in Computer Science at the University of Birmingham (which, I'm sure you know, is widely appreciated as the best city in the world). As part of this degree, I also got the opportunity to study abroad at the University of British Columbia and the University of Waterloo which was an added bonus. 

After my undergraduate degree, I worked for a couple of years in a research and development role for a start-up company that builds autonomous vehicle software. Here, my focus (amongst many things) was on the implementation of multi-objective route planning algorithms.
