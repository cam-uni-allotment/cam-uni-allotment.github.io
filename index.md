## <center>Academic Background</center>
<img src="/matriculation-photo-full.jpeg" width="200" class="left-img"/>

I am a PhD student in [Health Data Science](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/careers-in-health-data-science/phd-programme/) at the University of Cambridge, supported with a studentship from [Health Data Research UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/), the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), and the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/). 

I'm interested in developing multimorbidity risk prediction algorithms using machine learning; especially considering fairness and bias in this context. Moreover, I'm interested in how fair machine learning for healthcare can be done in a way to consider the environmental impact of these algorithms - especially since climate change disproportionately affects the most disadvantaged individuals globally and in the UK, including negatively impacting their health. I am currently supervised by [Angela Wood](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-senior-academic-staff/angela-wood/).

Previously, I was a [DeepMind Scholar](https://deepmind.com/scholarships) in MPhil Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, where I was supervised by [Neil Lawrence](https://inverseprobability.com/) and my research project focused on fairness and bias in machine learning. The photo of me here is from the happy day I matriculated into Clare Hall College, which is a wonderful college - not only because of the name!

I completed my first-class BSc in Computer Science at the University of Birmingham (which is widely appreciated as the best city in the world). As part of this degree, I also got the opportunity to study abroad at the University of British Columbia and the University of Waterloo, which was an added bonus. 

After my undergraduate degree, I worked for a couple of years in a research and development role for a start-up company that builds autonomous vehicle software. Here, my research focus (amongst many things) was on the implementation of multi-objective route planning algorithms. 

## Projects 
- <b>Axes of Prognosis</b>: Working with COVID-19 data from Wuhan, China, I collaborated with Emma Whitfield and [Honghan Wu](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=HWWUX46) on this project to identify and predict nuanced subtypes of COVID-19 prognosis. Our paper can be found [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.16.21253371v1)
- <b>Multi Objective Journey Optimisation</b>: In my previous life as an AI researcher in industry, in conjunction with the University of Birmingham, I worked on a project to create an AI journey optimisation system for autonomous vechicles. I am a named inventor on a [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190346275A1/en) for this work.

## Talks
As here isn't the right place to share my reality tv show appearances, here's a couple of academic talks I've recently done:
- <b>HDR UK Bimonthly Webinar</b>: I was invited by [Peter Diggle](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/diggle/) to join him in a conversation about the HDR UK PhD Programme in the [HDR UK bimonthly webinar](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/bimonthly-one-institute-webinars/).
- <b>UCL MedTech 2021</b>: I was invited to partake in the [UCL MedTech](https://uclmed.tech/) conference, to share my experiences and research so far in the hope to inspire undergraduate students at UCL.

## Articles
Here are a couple of articles written about me (paparazzi back off!):

## Personal Interests 
I really love music and singing, and am a member of [Clare Hall Choir](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/clare-hall-choir). I am into gardening and lockdown has meant that i've got a bit carried away with houseplants, so my flat is now half jungle. I'm also involved in the exciting new [Clare Hall Allotment](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/news/10-03-2021/clare-hall-allotment-initiative-officially-launches) where we're growing all sorts of fruit and vegetables sustainably. Eating these is an equally important hobby of mine.

I adore travelling, and especially exploring nature; I have a campervan which facillitates this, and can even work as a makeshift office (the perks of doing a computer-based PhD)! I also love taking photos of nature in an attempt to capture the beauty of the earth - in particular, of sunsets and mountains. At least we have one of these in Cambridge. 

I also enjoy hiking, yoga, dancing, and I have trained in Lau Gar Kung Fu.
