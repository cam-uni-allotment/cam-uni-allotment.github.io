## <center>Academic Background</center>
<img src="/matriculation-photo-full.jpeg" width="225" class="left-img"/>

I am a PhD student in Health Data Science at the University of Cambridge, on the [Health Data Research UK - Turing Institute Wellcome PhD Programme](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/careers-in-health-data-science/phd-programme/). I am currently in my PhD training year, supervised by [Angela Wood](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-senior-academic-staff/angela-wood/), and my research interests are in socially and environmentally conscious machine learning algorithms for multimorbidity disease risk prediction.

Previously, I was a [DeepMind Scholar](https://deepmind.com/scholarships) in MPhil Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, where I was supervised by [Neil Lawrence](https://inverseprobability.com/) and my research project focused on fairness and bias in machine learning. The photo of me here is from the happy day I matriculated into [Clare Hall](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/) College, which is a wonderful college - not only because of the name!

I completed my first-class BSc in Computer Science at the University of Birmingham (which is widely appreciated as the best city in the world). As part of this degree, I also got the opportunity to study abroad at the University of British Columbia and the University of Waterloo, which was an added bonus. 

After my undergraduate degree, I worked for a couple of years in a research and development role for a start-up company that builds autonomous vehicle software. Here, my research focus was on the implementation of multi-objective route planning algorithms. 

## <center>Projects</center>
- <b>Axes of Prognosis</b>: Working with COVID-19 data from Wuhan, China, I collaborated with Emma Whitfield and [Honghan Wu](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=HWWUX46) on this project to identify and predict nuanced subtypes of COVID-19 prognosis. Our paper can be found [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.16.21253371v1).
- <b>ThinkLab NHS Sustainability</b>: I am a member of the [University of Cambridge ThinkLab](https://www.thinklab.strategic-partnerships.admin.cam.ac.uk/), working on a project with the NHS in order to help develop a plan to achieve [net zero carbon emissions](https://www.england.nhs.uk/greenernhs/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2020/10/delivering-a-net-zero-national-health-service.pdf) and shape future policies.
- <b>HDR UK Student-led Seminar Series</b>: I am a member of the organising commitee for the student-led seminar series for my PhD cohort, organising and hosting seminar events. 
- <b>Multi Objective Journey Optimisation</b>: In my previous life as an AI researcher in industry, in conjunction with the University of Birmingham, I worked on a project to create an AI journey optimisation system for autonomous vechicles. I am a named inventor on a [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190346275A1/en) for this work.

## <center>Talks</center>
As here isn't the right place to share my reality tv show appearances, here's a couple of academic talks I've recently done:
- <b>HDR UK Bimonthly Webinar</b>: I was invited by [Peter Diggle](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/diggle/) to join him in a conversation about the HDR UK PhD Programme in the [HDR UK bimonthly webinar](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/bimonthly-one-institute-webinars/).
- <b>UCL MedTech 2021</b>: I was invited to partake in the [UCL MedTech](https://uclmed.tech/) conference, to share my experiences and research so far in the hope to inspire undergraduate students at UCL.

## <center>Articles</center>
Here are a couple of articles written about me (paparazzi back off!):

## <center>Personal Interests</center>
I really love music and singing, and am a member of [Clare Hall Choir](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/clare-hall-choir). I am into gardening and lockdown has meant that i've got a bit carried away with houseplants, so my flat is now half jungle. I'm also involved in the exciting new [Clare Hall Allotment](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/news/10-03-2021/clare-hall-allotment-initiative-officially-launches) where we're growing all sorts of fruit and vegetables sustainably. Eating these is an equally important hobby of mine.

I adore travelling, and especially exploring nature; I have a campervan which facillitates this, and can even work as a makeshift office (the perks of doing a computer-based PhD)! I also love taking photos of nature in an attempt to capture the beauty of the earth - in particular, of sunsets and mountains.

I also enjoy hiking, yoga, dancing, and I have trained in [Lau Gar Kung Fu](https://www.laugar-kungfu.com/).
