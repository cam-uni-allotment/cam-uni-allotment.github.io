# About me 

<img src="/matriculation-photo-full.jpeg" width="300" class="left"/>

I have recently started my PhD in [Health Data Science](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/careers-in-health-data-science/phd-programme/) at the University of Cambridge, with a studentship from Health Data Research UK, the Alan Turing Institute, and the Wellcome Trust. 

Before this, I was a DeepMind Scholar in MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, where my research project focused on fairness in machine learning. The photo of me here is from the happy day I matriculated into Clare Hall College, which is a wonderful college, and not only because of the name!

I completed my first-class BSc in Computer Science at the University of Birmingham. As part of this degree, I also got the opportunity to study abroad at the University of British Columbia and the University of Waterloo.
