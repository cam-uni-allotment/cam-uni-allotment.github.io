## <center>Academic Background</center>
<img src="/matriculation-photo-full.jpeg" width="225" class="left-img"/>

I am a PhD student in Health Data Science at the University of Cambridge, on the [Health Data Research UK - Turing Institute Wellcome PhD Programme](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/careers-in-health-data-science/phd-programme/), supervised by [Angela Wood](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-senior-academic-staff/angela-wood/) in the [Department of Public Health](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/). Currently, my research interests are in socially and environmentally conscious machine learning algorithms, especially in risk prediction and personalised medicine.

Previously, I was a [DeepMind Scholar](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/deepmind-scholars-cambridge) in MPhil Advanced Computer Science at the [Cambridge Computer Laboratory](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/), where I was supervised by [Neil Lawrence](https://inverseprobability.com/) and my research project focused on fairness in machine learning. The photo of me here is from the happy day I matriculated into [Clare Hall](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/) College, which is a wonderful college - and not only because of the name!

I completed my first-class BSc in Computer Science at the University of Birmingham (in Birmingham, UK, which is widely appreciated as the best city in the world). As part of this degree, I also got the opportunity to study abroad at the University of British Columbia and the University of Waterloo, which was an added bonus. 

After my undergraduate degree, I worked for a couple of years in a research and development role for a start-up company that builds artificial intelligence software for autonomous vehicles. Here, my research focus was on the implementation of multi-objective route planning algorithms. 

## <center>Projects</center>
#### Current
- <b> Reinforcement learning for healthcare</b>: I am working on a project wherein I explore various reinforcement learning paradigms. Using this knowledge, I hope to apply RL to healthcare in the context of multimorbidity trajectory modelling. [Chris Yau](https://cwcyau.github.io/authors/admin/) is supervising me on this project.
- <b>ThinkLab NHS sustainability</b>: I am a member of the [University of Cambridge ThinkLab](https://www.thinklab.strategic-partnerships.admin.cam.ac.uk/), working on a project with the NHS and [Cambridge Zero](https://www.zero.cam.ac.uk/) in order to develop a plan to achieve [net zero carbon emissions](https://www.england.nhs.uk/greenernhs/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2020/10/delivering-a-net-zero-national-health-service.pdf) and shape future policies.
- <b>HDR UK student-led seminar series</b>: I am a member of the organising commitee for the student-led seminar series for my PhD cohort, organising and hosting seminar events. 

#### Past
- <b>Axes of prognosis</b>: Working with COVID-19 data from Wuhan, China, I collaborated with Emma Whitfield on this project supervised by [Honghan Wu](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=HWWUX46) to identify and predict nuanced subtypes of COVID-19 prognosis. Our paper can be found [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.16.21253371v1).
- <b>Fairness and the bias-variance trade-off</b>: For my MPhil thesis, I explored bias and variance errors in automated decision making in the context of fairness, using data on criminal recidivism. 
- <b>Multi objective journey optimisation</b>: As part of my R&D job, in conjunction with the University of Birmingham, I worked on a project to create an AI journey optimisation system for autonomous vechicles. I am a named inventor on a [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190346275A1/en) on this topic. I also worked on this for my final-year BSc project, supervised by [Dave Parker](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~parkerdx/index.php), where I was nominated for the research dissertation prize.

## <center>Talks</center>
As here isn't the right place to share my reality tv show appearances, here's a couple of academic talks I've recently done:
- <b>HDR UK Bimonthly Webinar</b>: I was invited by [Peter Diggle](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/diggle/) to join him in a conversation about the HDR UK PhD Programme in the [HDR UK bimonthly webinar](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/events/hdr-uk-bimonthly-science-webinar-january-2021/).
- <b>UCL MedTech 2021</b>: I was invited to partake in the [UCL MedTech](https://uclmed.tech/) conference, to share my experiences and research so far in the hope to inspire undergraduate students at UCL.

### <center>Personal Interests</center>
I really love music and singing, and am a member of [Clare Hall Choir](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/clare-hall-choir). 

I am into gardening and lockdown has meant that I have got a bit carried away, so my flat is now half jungle. I'm also involved in running the exciting new [Clare Hall Allotment](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/news/10-03-2021/clare-hall-allotment-initiative-officially-launches) where we're growing all sorts of fruit and vegetables sustainably. Cooking and eating these is an equally important hobby of mine.

I adore travelling, and especially exploring nature; I have a campervan which facillitates this, and can even work as a makeshift office! I also love taking photos of nature in an attempt to capture its beauty - in particular, of sunsets and mountains.

My other hobbies include hiking, yoga, digital art, dancing, and I have trained in Lau Gar Kung Fu.
