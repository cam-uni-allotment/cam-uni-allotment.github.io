### Academic Background
<img src="/matriculation-photo-full.jpeg" width="200" class="left-img"/>

My name's Claire Coffey and welcome to my self-indulgent website, all about _me_. I have recently started my PhD in [Health Data Science](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/careers-in-health-data-science/phd-programme/) at the University of Cambridge, with a studentship from Health Data Research UK, the Alan Turing Institute, and the Wellcome Trust. I really hope to be able to make a positive difference 

Before this, I was a DeepMind Scholar in MPhil Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, where I was supervised by Neil Lawrence and my research project focused on fairness in machine learning. The photo of me here is from the happy day I signed a very big book to matriculate into Clare Hall College, which is a wonderful college - not only because of the name!

I completed my first-class BSc in Computer Science at the University of Birmingham (which, I'm sure you know, is widely appreciated as the best city in the world). As part of this degree, I also got the opportunity to study abroad at the University of British Columbia and the University of Waterloo which was an added bonus. 

After my undergraduate degree, I worked for a couple of years in a research and development role for a start-up company that builds autonomous vehicle software. Here, my focus (amongst many things) was on the implementation of multi-objective route planning algorithms. 

### Personal Interests 
I really love music and singing, and am a member of [Clare Hall Choir](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/clare-hall-choir). I am into gardening and lockdown has meant that i've got a bit carried away with houseplants, so my flat is now half jungle. I'm also involved in the exciting new [Clare Hall Allotment](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/news/10-03-2021/clare-hall-allotment-initiative-officially-launches) where we're growing all sorts of fruit and vegetables. Eating these is an equally important hobby of mine.

I adore travelling, and especially exploring nature; I have a campervan which facillitates this, and can even work as a makeshift office (the perks of doing a computer-based PhD)! I also love taking photos of nature to help remember the beauty of the earth - before it explodes due to climate change - in particular, of sunsets and mountains. At least we have one of these in Cambridge.
