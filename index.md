## Academic Background
<img src="/matriculation-photo-full.jpeg" width="200" class="left-img"/>

I have recently started my PhD in [Health Data Science](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/careers-in-health-data-science/phd-programme/) at the University of Cambridge, supported with a studentship from [Health Data Research UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/), the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), and the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/). I would love to make a genuine positive difference with my work; and I feel that applying my computer science knowledge to healthcare problems is one of the most impactful ways to do this. 

I'm interested in developing multimorbidity risk prediction algorithms using machine learning; especially considering fairness and bias in this context. Moreover, I'm interested in how machine learning for healthcare can be done in a way to consider the environmental impact of these algorithms - especially since climate change disproportionately affects the most disadvantaged individuals globally and in the UK, including negatively impacting their health.

Before this, I was a DeepMind Scholar in MPhil Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, where I was supervised by [Neil Lawrence](https://inverseprobability.com/) and my research project focused on fairness and bias in machine learning - a topic which I feel is extremely important and needs to be addressed. The photo of me here is from the happy day I matriculated into Clare Hall College, which is a wonderful college - not only because of the name!

I completed my first-class BSc in Computer Science at the University of Birmingham (which is widely appreciated as the best city in the world). As part of this degree, I also got the opportunity to study abroad at the University of British Columbia and the University of Waterloo, which was an added bonus. 

After my undergraduate degree, I worked for a couple of years in a research and development role for a start-up company that builds autonomous vehicle software. Here, my research focus (amongst many things) was on the implementation of multi-objective route planning algorithms. I am a named inventor on a [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190346275A1/en) for this work.

## Projects 
- <b>[Axes of Prognosis]</b>(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.16.21253371v1): As part of my PhD training, I had the opportunity to work with COVID-19 data from Wuhan, China. I collaborated with Emma Whitfield and Honghan Wu on this project to identify and predict nuanced subtypes of COVID-19 prognosis.
- <b>Reinforcement Learning for Healthcare</b>: I am currently working on a project on reinforcement learning, supervised by Chris Yau, in which I hope to gain a deep understanding of the field, and apply this to multimorbidity trajectory modelling. 

## Talks
As a famous researcher all around the globe, I'm practically a household name. As here isn't the right place to share my reality tv show appearances, here's a couple of brief descriptions of talks I've recently done:
- <b>HDR UK Bimonthly Webinar</b>: I was invited by Peter Diggle to join him in a conversation about the HDR UK PhD Programme in the HDR UK bimonthly webinar.
- <b>UCL MedTech</b>: I was invited to partake in the UCL MedTech 2021 event, to share my experiences and research so far in the hope to inspire undergraduate students at UCL.

## Articles
Here are a couple of articles written about me (paparazzi back off!):

## Personal Interests 
I really love music and singing, and am a member of [Clare Hall Choir](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/clare-hall-choir). I am into gardening and lockdown has meant that i've got a bit carried away with houseplants, so my flat is now half jungle. I'm also involved in the exciting new [Clare Hall Allotment](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/news/10-03-2021/clare-hall-allotment-initiative-officially-launches) where we're growing all sorts of fruit and vegetables. Eating these is an equally important hobby of mine.

I adore travelling, and especially exploring nature; I have a campervan which facillitates this, and can even work as a makeshift office (the perks of doing a computer-based PhD)! I also love taking photos of nature to help remember the beauty of the earth - before it explodes due to climate change - in particular, of sunsets and mountains. At least we have one of these in Cambridge. 

I'm into health and fitness, and I especially enjoy hiking, yoga, dancing, and I have trained in Lau Gar Kung Fu.
